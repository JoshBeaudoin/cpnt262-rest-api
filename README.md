* For this project we had to pull public apis so the one i chose to do was Clash Royal, i picked this one because i used to play Clash Royal alot on my phone when i was youngr so i knew all of the characters from it which made it a bit easier as i could know if its wrong or not.
* I struggled quite a bit with this project and ended up having to watch quite a few youtube videos, links tony had provided and talked to a few classmates (all resourses linked at bottom) So i can not give myself a high grade for this one so my self grade would be 5/10, besides the struggle of figuring it out im really not sure how well i even got it to run and am just hoping i have placed the right code in the right spot so for that i cant give myself a high grade.
* I feel like i have learned alot from the beginning of this course so it is cool to see what i know now vs what i could do before and am starting to actually learn alot which is cool for me
